# Duckuino ![release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Nurrl/Duckuino/all.svg)
Simple DuckyScript to Arduino converter.

If you need to perform mouse emulation then use [d4n5h's Duckuino](https://github.com/d4n5h/Duckuino).

*NOTE: If you are on linux, you might use the Arduino IDE from the website, not from apt, because the apt repo is not up to date.*

### Warning: Version note
This version is an unstable version, for now some things may not work, the known issues are:  
Compiler :
  * DEFAULTDELAY does nothing.

UI :
  * Merged button and select boxes are not synchronised, so when a button is disabled, the select arrow won't be disabled.

*The stable version will be released in few days, maybe :D*
# Live version:
https://nurrl.github.io/Duckuino/

# Why Duckuino ?
You can compile duckyscript to arduino code directly through the [live](https://nurrl.github.io/Duckuino/ "Duckuino Live") version, or reuse <code>Duckuino.js</code> for standalone use :
```javascript
/* Need to fill */
```
Output:

```c
/* Need to fill */
```
